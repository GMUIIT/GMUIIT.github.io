			The mission of the Inventors and Innovations Team (IIT) is to connect like-minded students 
				to express their interests in engineering and technology, to actively build and bring their 
				ideas to reality. The focus is to give students the chance to develop their technical skills 
				through hands-on construction of devices. IIT wishes to create an environment where all student 
				ideas are accepted.
