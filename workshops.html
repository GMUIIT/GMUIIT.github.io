  <button class="accordion">Basic Electrical Components | March TBD</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this Components workshop, IIT will explain basic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and OP Amps.
	  There will also be an overview of circuit laws such as Kirchhoff's Laws and Ohm's Law using voltage sources. 
	  Other commonly used components/tools such as ICs, multimeters, oscilloscopes, voltage sources, transformers,
	  transistors (God Bless the Transistor), etc. may be discussed briefly.  </p>

<button class="accordion">KiCAD Digital Design | March / April TBD</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this KiCAD workshop, IIT will demonstrate why KiCAD is such an important tool when
	designing circuits or other electrical projects. We will teach members how to make a new KiCAD project,
	how to find some components like capacitors, resistors, and voltage sources and how to manipulate
	them in the KiCAD software such as rotating the pieces and adding wires between components.
	We will then explain how to export a project and how to add stuff from digikey. Finally, members will
	put all their new knowledge together and create a circuit of their own!  </p>

<button class="accordion">Raspberry Pi / Arduino | April TBD</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> In this Raspberry Pi/Arduino Workshop, IIT will give an introduction to SoCs and
	  microcontrollers using a Raspberry Pi4 B+ (4Gb Ram) and an Arduino [Please fill here].
	  Terms such as GPIO, SSH, and GNU will be explained. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">3D Printing / AutoCAD | April / May TBD</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this 3D printing Workshop, IIT will give an introduction to 3D printing. This
	  introduction will help you on your path to getting a Mix 3D printing certification,
	  but you need to actually have a certification before printing by yourself.</p>
